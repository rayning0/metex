# Metex: Weather app

From [The Little Elixir & OTP Guidebook](https://github.com/rayning0/elixir-otp-guidebook). We build 2 versions: non-concurrent, then concurrent.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `metex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:metex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/metex>.
